# FlashFocus 

**FlashFocus** is a small, lightweight front-end web app designed to help you stay focused with short, timed sessions. It's built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so you can open it locally or deploy it as a static site.

---

##  Features

- Simple, distraction-free UI
- Configurable focus/short break cycles
- Minimal dependencies — pure HTML/CSS/JS

> Note: Adjust the features below if your local implementation differs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the app locally.
   - Or run a simple static server from the project folder:
     - Python: `python -m http.server 8000` and visit `http://localhost:8000`.
     - VS Code: use the **Live Server** extension.

---

### Running locally 🔧

- Start a simple server from the project folder (examples):
  - Python (works in PowerShell or Command Prompt): `python -m http.server 8000`
  - Node (serve): `npx serve -l 8000`
- Access the app at: `http://localhost:8000/` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (the server may print `http://[::]:8000/` when bound to IPv6).
- **Live Server (VS Code):** `http://127.0.0.1:5500/FlashFocus/index.html` (Live Server commonly uses port **5500**)
- Stop the server: press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal.
- Change the port: use a different number (e.g., `python -m http.server 3000`) if 8000 or 5500 is in use.
